## Abstract
Videos are frozen fragment shots of a past reality. That is no wonder why within the
last decade, and with the emergence of social media and videoconferencing tools, a huge
number of users upload, download, share, and communicate using video streams. That
being said, with the constantly increasing bit rates and the apparition of HD and 4k videos,
Quality of Experience (QoE) becomes thus a critical aspect to take into consideration in
the different communication systems. Accordingly, it become essential to evaluate the
quality of those different videos in order to be able to optimize their processing.
User Generated Videos represent however two main challenges in their evaluation process:
first, no reference pristine video is available for the sake of comparison, second, they are
altered by an unpredictable and authentic set of distortions that can occur on both spatial
and temporal dimensions.
Thereby, we introduce a blind video quality assessment model ResTimeSFormer, that
combines the advantage given by the high quality of CNNs extracted features and the
spatio-temporal aspect of the novel TimeSFormer architecture. Moreover, in order to take
full advantage of the tranformer network, we make it possible to parallelize the feature
extraction process on different nodes, for the sake of computational run time reduction.
